# Sensor-Based Human Activity Classification Challenge


### Models Used
    * RNN
    * LSTM
    * GRU
    * Transformer
    * CNN
    * CNN & FeedForward

### Libraries

        1. NumPy
        2. Pandas – for data loading and preprocessing
        3. Matplotlib – for plotting training/validation curves
        4. Scikit-learn – for evaluation metrics, class balancing, and scaling
        5. PyTorch – for building, training, and evaluating LSTM, GRU, RNN, Transformer, CNN  and CNN & FeedForward models

### Steps to evaluate


    1. To evaluate a trained model using a test CSV file:

    2. Upload csv file

    3. Scroll to the section titled Evaluation

    4. Run all the cells under that heading to:

        * Load the model from checkpoint.

        * Preprocess the test data with correct path.

        * Predict and compute evaluation metrics like accuracy, macro F1, and confusion matrix
